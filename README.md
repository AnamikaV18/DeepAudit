# DeepAudit
A streamlined machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Built using Logistic Regression, the system performs binary classification to distinguish between legitimate purchases and suspicious activity based on historical transaction patterns.

🚀 Key Features
Probabilistic Classification: Predicts the likelihood of fraud using a sigmoid function, allowing for adjustable sensitivity thresholds.
Feature Importance: Identifies key risk factors—such as transaction amount and location—that contribute most to fraudulent behavior.
Optimized Performance: Engineered to handle highly imbalanced datasets using techniques like SMOTE (Oversampling) or class-weight adjustment.
